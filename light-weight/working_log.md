# Working Log

This document tracks the progress and challenges in developing the OpenSim Lifter Visualization application.

## Progress Summary

We have made significant progress on Phase 1 and have begun Phase 2 of the development plan.

### Phase 1: Foundation and Core Viewer (Completed)

1.  **Project Initialization:** Confirmed the setup of the Vite React project in the `light-weight` directory with all necessary dependencies (`tailwindcss`, `zustand`, `@react-three/fiber`, etc.).
2.  **UI Layout:** Created the main application layout, including a `Sidebar` for future controls and a `Viewer` area for the 3D model.
3.  **3D Scene:** Implemented a basic 3D scene using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`, complete with camera controls, lighting, and a ground plane.
4.  **Sample Model:** Successfully loaded a sample `arm26.gltf` model into the viewer to validate the core 3D functionality.

### Phase 2: "Big 3" Lifts Integration (In Progress)

1.  **Model Sourcing:** The user has successfully sourced and downloaded the `.osim` files for the three target lifts:
    *   **Squat:** `Catelli-V4.0.osim`
    *   **Bench Press:** `MoBL_ARMS_bimanual_6_2_21.osim`
    *   **Deadlift:** `LFB_model.osim`
2.  **File Organization:** The full model packages, including their necessary geometry files (`.vtp`), have been placed in the `light-weight/public/models_original/` directory.
3.  **Conversion Script:** A Python script, `light-weight/scripts/convert_models.py`, has been created to automate the conversion of these `.osim` models into the web-friendly `.gltf` format.

## Current Status & Challenges

We are currently focused on getting the Python conversion script to run successfully. This has been the most significant hurdle so far due to the complexities of the scientific Python environment required for the task.

### Problems Encountered and Solutions Implemented:

1.  **`ModuleNotFoundError: no module named 'opensim'`:**
    *   **Problem:** The initial attempt to run the script failed because the core `opensim` library was not installed.
    *   **Solution:** We determined that the available `opensim` package required a specific version of Python (3.12), which conflicted with the user's default environment. We resolved this by creating a dedicated Conda environment (`opensim-env`) with the correct Python version and installing `opensim` into it.

2.  **`ModuleNotFoundError: no module named 'pygltflib'` and `'vtk'`:**
    *   **Problem:** The conversion scripts had other dependencies that were not installed in our new `opensim-env`.
    *   **Solution:** We installed these packages (`pygltflib`, `vtk`) into the Conda environment using `pip`.

3.  **`ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package`:**
    *   **Problem:** The Python scripts were originally written as part of a larger package and used relative imports (e.g., `from . import ...`), which fail when a script is run directly.
    *   **Solution:** I modified all the conversion scripts to use absolute imports (e.g., `from ...`) instead.

4.  **File Not Saving:**
    *   **Problem:** An early version of the `convert_models.py` script was executing the conversion process in memory but failing to save the resulting `.gltf` file to disk.
    *   **Solution:** I rewrote the script to import the conversion functions directly (rather than using a subprocess) and explicitly call the `.save()` method on the generated GLTF data.

### Current Task

*   **Problem:** The last error indicated that the geometry files (`.vtp`) referenced inside the `.osim` models could not be found.
*   **Status:** The user has moved the complete model packages into `light-weight/public/models_original/`. I have just updated the `convert_models.py` script to point to the new file locations and provide the correct search paths for the geometry.

### Next Step

The immediate next step is to **run the latest version of the `convert_models.py` script** from within the activated `opensim-env` Conda environment. The recent changes are expected to resolve the geometry path issue and finally produce the `.gltf` model files we need for the application.
